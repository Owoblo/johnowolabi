# Building a Sustainable Creative Process

Creativity isn't a finite resource, but it does require careful cultivation.

## The Myth of Inspiration

Waiting for inspiration is like waiting for the perfect weather to go for a walk. Sometimes you just need to start moving, and the momentum carries you forward.

## Small Steps, Big Changes

The most sustainable creative practices are built on small, consistent actions rather than grand gestures. A few minutes of writing each day compounds into something meaningful over time.

## Rest as Part of the Process

True creativity requires both focused work and intentional rest. The space between projects isn't empty timeâ€”it's where new connections form and fresh ideas emerge.

## Finding Your Rhythm

Everyone's creative rhythm is different. Some work best in the early morning, others late at night. The key is finding what works for you and protecting that time fiercely.

What's your creative rhythm? How do you maintain it?
