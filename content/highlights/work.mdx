# Work & Process

Documenting the creative process, from initial concepts to final execution. The messy middle that makes good work possible.

## Current Projects

Working on several client projects that explore the boundaries of minimal design and maximum impact.

## Process Notes

- Starting with constraints
- The value of iteration
- Knowing when to stop
